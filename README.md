# BUCS databases

This repository contains the following:

1. Small CSV files that can be loaded into practice databases
2. The scripts used to generate those files so that others can expand them

It has the following rules:

1. **No query information or other homework answers**. This is just about providing people with practice data
2. **Be reproducible**. Comment your code so it's easier to catch and post mistakes. Attach README files to explain your reasoning if you need to.
