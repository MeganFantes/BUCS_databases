# CS 660 written assignment 1

Just some notes on what's in here:
- These tables are what I could come up with over the course of a couple hours, for my own use as practice data to help write queries for the homework questions.
- I think the relationships in them make sense but there may be imperfections (for exmaple, in problem 1, some suppliers sell the same part multiple times at different prices).
- If you want to improve the tables or the script, feel free to edit and run the R code.
